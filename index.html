    <p> Through the inception of All Elite Wrestling in 2019, there is a trend showing the Twitter followers of a certain wrestler directly correlates with their time wrestling in the ring. From the data you can see AEW Executive Vice President Cody
      Rhodes is one of AEW's current biggest stars who receives more time in the ring than others. His Twitter followers (about 1 million and counting) are a big reason why he is able to spend so much time in the ring. In both the mens and women's
      graphs you can see that wrestlers with larger amounts of Twitter followers are further away on their graphs respective X-axis than their contemporaries with smaller Twitter followings. For example, in the mens graphs you see a clutter of AEW
      talent such as members of Jungle Express, Private Party, as well as Joey Janela with under 12 minutes of an average match duration. Members of The Elite all have 400,000 twitter followers and higher, and all are averaging 15 minutes or higher
      of average match duration. It is not just members of The Elite that are in this category. Inaugural AEW Champion Chris Jericho (as of this writing) and his 3,600,000 Twitter followers was too much to handle for this experiment, and literally
      broke the graph as the amount of followers was too high to give an accurate description of the remainder of the data. As such, Luchasaurus has been inserted into the chart. </p>
